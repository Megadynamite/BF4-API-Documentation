# BF4-API-Documentation
Documentation of the BF4 Battlelog JSON API

I assume if you're looking at this it's because you went through my profile and not because you actually wanted to use any of it. If that isn't the case, rethink your life choices.

### Disclaimers
This is a side project as I mess with the API. It is not guaranteed to be useful, up to date, or right. There are a lot of keys that I have no reasonable idea what they do. If I make a guess it will be marked.

### Eventual goal
Have all of the JSON endpoints sorted, the keys explained, I'd like to have it so that you can search a term and reasonably be told the various endpoints to retrieve it. The headers required for an endpoint should also be somewhere about.

### Not Happening:

I will not be putting in the effort to track every internal code and codename to an object. Some of them are incredbly odd

Actually giving myself a schedule: The endpoints are ridiculous and there is only so much looking at the same information repeated 12 times that I can deal with.
